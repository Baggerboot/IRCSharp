IRCSharp
========

IRCSharp is an IRC library written for use in C#/.NET applications, like IRC bots or clients.

**What does it do**

Currently, not much, as it's still under active development. It currently allows you to do the following:
- Connect to an IRC server
- Join a channel
- Receive messages
- Receive raw IRC lines
- Receive nick change events
- Send messages
- Send raw IRC lines
- Change nick

I've written this library because there don't seen to be any IRC libraries for .NET yet. 
If you want to use this library, feel free to request any features by opening an issue, and I'll try to implement them.
Because the library is still in a very early stage, there are currently no stable releases. 
I will attempt to not have any broken builds on here, but I can't make any promises.
